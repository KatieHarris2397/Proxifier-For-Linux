NAME
 proxifier - Proxifier For Linux

SYNOPSIS
 systemctl {start| stop| restart| status}  proxifier[.service]

DESCRIPTION
 proxifier acts as an intermediate between the proxy servers and client programs. Not all programs are capable of working through proxy servers. 
 Moreover, it is tiresome to configure proxy settings for each application. proxifier aims to solve these two issues, work through the proxy servers on behalf of 
 the other programs, and a global point for configuring proxy rules, which will be applied to every program in the system. 

 proxifier supports HTTP_PROXY.

OPTIONS
 proxifier is intended to run as a system service, see the CONFIGURATION FILE section for configuring proxifier.
 
CONFIGURATION FILE
 proxifier provides the service by registering the proxy_handler threads. For each proxy_block in the configuration file, a proxy_handler thread is registered. 
 Taking advantage of it, one can configure multiple proxy_blocks (or proxy servers) for dealing with a specific destination port traffic. See the file /usr/local/etc/proxifier.conf
 for a template proxy_block.
 
NOTE
 In the HTTP_PROXY environment, the network administrator need not configure a DNS resolver. The proxy server resolves, and establishes a tunnel or fetches the content on 
 behalf of the client. But since we are masking away the details of the proxy environment, the client programs attempt for DNS resolution. As of now, the proxifier is unable 
 to deal with this (work in progress). So a configured DNS resolver is expected for the smooth operation of proxifier.

EXAMPLES
 Start the proxifier service
 	
 	# systemctl start proxifier

 Stop the proxifier service
 	
 	# systemctl stop proxifier

 Reload the configuration files
 	
 	# systemctl restart proxifier
