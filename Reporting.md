# Reporting

Your bug-reports are much appreciated! Follow the following steps while reporting any undefined, undesired, and unexpected behavior. Alternatively, you can request a feature, which afterthought will be added to the TODO list

* [Proxifier-For-Linux](https://github.com/m0hithreddy/Proxifier-For-Linux/) is expected to be an active project. So before reporting, fetch the latest sources from the master branch and see if the error persists. 

* You can raise an issue in the GitHub (make sure you won't upload any sensitive information like usernames and passwords).
